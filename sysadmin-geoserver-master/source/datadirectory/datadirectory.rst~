GeoServer Data Directory
########################
The GeoServer data directory is the location in the file system where GeoServer stores its configuration information. The configuration defines things such as what data is served by GeoServer, where it is stored, and how services such as WFS and WMS interact with and serve the data. The data directory also contains a number of support files used by GeoServer for various purposes.

=============================
Creating a New Data Directory
=============================
The easiest way to create a new data directory is to copy one that comes with a standard GeoServer installation.

If GeoServer is running in Standalone mode the data directory is located at <installation root>/data_dir.
If GeoServer is running as Web Archive mode inside of a servlet container, the data directory is located at <web application root>/data.
